    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section>I am a software professional with a rich experience in all areas of the SDLC.  I have experience as a developer, a product manager, and as a director of technology.  I balance a keen eye for usability with pragmatic decision making.  Because of my passion for quality usable software, I have gravitated towards front-end engineering.  However, I consider myself a full stack developer and have experience and ability for coding in all aspects of software development.</section>
